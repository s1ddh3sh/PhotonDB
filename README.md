# ⚡ PhotonDB

**PhotonDB** is a lightweight, high-performance in-memory key-value database server written in vanilla C++17. It features a custom binary protocol, and a hashtable-based storage engine.

What sets PhotonDB apart is its native support for [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — the Model Context Protocol — enabling seamless, natural-language interactions with the database engine. With MCP, PhotonDB becomes more than a data store — it becomes a conversational system that understands high-level user intents in context.
